# Final-Year-Project---Linear-2nd-Order-BVPs-by-FDM-Using-R-LaTeX

This repository contains my **Final Year Thesis** focusing on the **application of the Finite Difference Method (FDM)** to solve second-order Boundary Value Problems (BVPs).  

Second-order BVPs frequently appear in science and engineering, including **material stress analysis, fluid flow, and heat transfer**. This study demonstrates how FDM can provide **accurate, stable, and efficient numerical solutions**, including analysis of grid size effects on solution accuracy and convergence.  

The thesis was **completely written and formatted in LaTeX**, which allowed me to **complete the documentation faster than traditional word processing**, while maintaining high-quality formatting for equations, tables, and figures.  

## üîπ Key Highlights
- Implementation of **central difference scheme** for second-order differential equations.  
- Numerical algorithms developed under **Dirichlet boundary conditions**.  
- Performance analysis in terms of **efficiency, stability, and accuracy**.  
- Comparison of approximate solutions with exact solutions where available.  
- Analysis of **grid size effect** on convergence.  
- Thesis fully completed using **R for numerical computation** and **LaTeX for documentation**.
